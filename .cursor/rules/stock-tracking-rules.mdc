## 0. Prime directive  
*Do not change behaviour, APIs, or formatting unless explicitly asked.*

## 1. Ask first, change later  
1. If a request is ambiguous or risks breaking existing behaviour, **ask a clarifying question** instead of guessing.  

## 2. Scope & minimal‑diff etiquette  
1. Touch only the lines required to satisfy the request.  
2. Preserve import order, naming conventions, comments, and licence headers.  
3. Never introduce new dependencies, config files, or build steps without the user’s explicit approval.

## 3. Style & conventions  
1. Follow the project’s ESLint/Prettier/EditorConfig rules; if missing, adopt the dominant style in surrounding code.  
2. Keep TypeScript strict‑null‑checks on; avoid `any`.  
3. Functions must have meaningful names and typed parameters / return values.

## 4. Safety checks before proposing changes  
1. Scan for existing unit/integration tests and ensure suggested edits keep them green.  
2. If no tests exist, include a test stub for any bug‑fix you introduce.  
3. Never delete error handling, logging, or accessibility attributes.
